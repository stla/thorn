## Release summary

This is a resubmission. The previous submission has been archived because there 
was a missing 'if(interactive())' in an example. So I added it.

## Test environments

* ubuntu 18.04, R 3.6.3
* win-builder (devel & release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
